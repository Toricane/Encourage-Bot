Perseverance is a multi-purpose bot coded in Python. It has moderation, fun, and text commands, with many more in the future. Perseverance is currently being developed by a single person. Perseverance was created on February 16, 2021, by Toricane#0001. Join Perseverance's Discord server to learn how to use it and to give feedback!

The prefix for the bot is ".". Use .help to find all of the commands, and .help <command> to know more about a specific command. 

The bot also has slash commands. Type "/" in the text box and the list of commands will appear.
